1. Anomalous sites:
f2ccnvjt8tju8bfvnfci.net
2hpnvpyglwmol91u94jb.org

2. IP addresses of anomalous sites (respectively):
167.203.181.112
208.34.7.190

3. Computers in local network with at least one incoming connection: 254

4. Unique IPs of incoming connections of 148 random computers:
192.168.193.118

5. As many computers received an incoming connection from the same IP, we can assume that this was done not by a user but a bot. We consider that this IP address belongs to a bot because we really have no way of knowing if that computer is a network admin, so itâ€™s strange that one sole computer has so many connections to so many others.

6. IP from question 4 has communicated with:
f2ccnvjt8tju8bfvnfci.net
2hpnvpyglwmol91u94jb.org

7. First connections:
